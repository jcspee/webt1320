            <p>Fortnite: Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players collaborating
                towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across
                Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like
                "husks". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving
                survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the
                storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters,
                weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to
                improve their attributes.
                Fortnite is set on contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98% of
                the world's population to disappear, and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder. Considered
                by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on
                various missions on different maps to collect resources, build fortifications around defensive
                objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps
                to engage in combat with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain
                rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon
                and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions.</p>

            <p>Lego Fortnite is an open world survival video game, developed and published by Epic Games in association
                with The Lego Group. It was released on December 7, 2023, for Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
                PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. The game can be accessed and played within the
                Fortnite game application.
                Before entering, players can select the Lego Fortnite game mode option while in the lobby. Upon doing
                so, the player's normal outfit, if compatible, will be converted into a minifigure. They can then select
                a world, with some options including turning on or off hunger, hostile mobs, and dying, as well as
                having the ability to invite up to eight players in a single world. After this is done and the game has
                started, players can roam around the map, and collect materials, such as wood, by punching trees, while
                also being able to build buildings and tools. They will also have to keep an eye out for enemy mobs, if
                this option was activated, such as spiders, wolves, and skeletons. When dealt with damage, players can
                heal themselves by consuming items such as pumpkins, corn, eggs, raspberries, meat, etc. Fireflies will
                also appear from time to time, and are unable to be caught due to their speed. Instead, players can
                follow them, which will lead to them discovering chests and loot llamas, the latter of which will
                explode with items after being pet.</p>
