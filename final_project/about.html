            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Fortnite is a third person shooter survival game where the player has to survive against up to 99 other
                players. The total player count for each battle royale is 100. The player can build forts through
                collecting materials such as metal, bricks, and wood, and collect weapons before fighting other players.
                The main game also has a mode called Fortnite: Save The World, which is also available as a separate
                game. While Battle Royale is free, Save The World is a paid game. The game can be played on Nintendo
                Switch, Windows, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Android.</p>

            <p>Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is
                available in six distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game
                engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be
                the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and
                survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps
                and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to
                create worlds and battle arenas, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival.</p>

            <p>Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was
                released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for
                Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural
                phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of
                dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019.
                Save the World is available for macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and
                Creative were released for all those platforms, and also for Android and iOS devices and Nintendo
                Switch. The game also launched with the release of the ninth-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
                X/S consoles. Furthermore, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival are releasing on all
                available platforms.</p>
