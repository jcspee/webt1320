            <h2>About Minecraft</h2>
            <p>Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with and modify a dynamically-generated map
                made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs and
                items. Some activities in the game include building, mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs and crafting
                new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model
                allows players to create structures, creations and artwork on various competitive or collaborative
                multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic
                computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A
                designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End and
                defeat the ender dragon.</p>
