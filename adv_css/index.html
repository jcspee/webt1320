            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game created by Swedish game developer Markus "Notch" Persson. It is maintained
                by Mojang Studios, a part of Xbox Game Studios, which in turn is part of Microsoft. From its creation,
                Minecraft was developed almost exclusively by Notch until Jens "Jeb" Bergensten started working with him
                and has since become head of its development. It features music by Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld, Kumi
                Tanioka, Lena Raine and Aaron Cherof, as well as paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand. Initially
                released as what is now known as Minecraft Classic on May 17, 2009, the game was fully released on
                November 18, 2011. Since its release, Minecraft has expanded to mobile devices and consoles. On November
                6, 2014, Minecraft and all of Mojang Studios' assets were acquired by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion.
                Notch has since left Mojang and is no longer working on Minecraft.</p>

                <p>Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. Blocks can be used to reshape the
                    world or build fantastical creations. Creatures can be battled or befriended, depending on your
                    playstyle. Experience epic adventures solo or with friends, there's no wrong way to play.
                    Unless you're digging straight down.</p>
